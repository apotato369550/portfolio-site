            <h1>Hello World! I'm JAY</h1>
            <p>Hi there! My name is John, but most people call me <span className="name">JAY</span>. I'm a software engineer based in Cebu City with a passion for programming, fullstack development, and machine learning. I'm dedicated to learning as much as I can about computers and computer science while having fun in doing so.</p>
            <br />
            <h1>The Journey</h1>
            <p>I've been coding since I was 9. I see programming as a nice hobby, but I'm always interested in taking things to the next level.</p>
            <p>I embarked on this journey into the world of computers and computer science with a desire to become a top game developer. My desire has evolved a lot since then. Over the years, I've had the privilege of developing more than just games. </p>
            <h1>What I do</h1>
            <p>I'm a very well rounded coder and I have delved into many different technologies, but I'm most experienced with Python and fullstack development.</p>
